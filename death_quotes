I joyfully await the exit – and I hope never to return
It’s part of the privilege of being human that we have our moment when we have to say goodbye
The bitterest tears shed over graves are for words left unsaid and deeds left undone
In the midst of death, life persists. In the midst of untruth, truth persists. In the midst of darkness, light persists
Though lovers be lost, love shall not
In life, we weep at the thought of death. In death, perhaps we weep at the thought of life
